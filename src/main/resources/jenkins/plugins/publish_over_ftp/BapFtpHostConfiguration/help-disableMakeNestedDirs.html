    <p>Do not try to create nested directories with a single MKD command.</p>
    <p>The default behaviour when creating directories is to try to create the target directory
        including any missing directories with a single command. If this fails, the plugin
        will fall back to creating each directory individually. Some FTP servers, when asked to create
        nested directories will respond with a success code, but will not create the directories
        correctly. This will result in directories being created in incorrect branches of the directory
        tree.</p>
    <p>This option will not prevent the creation of nested directories, it is just a fix for badly
        behaved FTP servers.</p>
